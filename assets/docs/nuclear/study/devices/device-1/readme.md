# The Device-1
Codename: Bellator-UPREY-1
Device with main core containing:
- Rutherfordium
- Einsteinium
- Ytterbium
- Plutonium
- Uranium

Stats:
 - Shape created to provide one increasement of pressure / heat with moderated curve
    when the curve ascend to the first top the pressure reach in the extrem levels
    providing the total amount of energy to mantain the entire process of fusion/fission
    the other elements are fussioned after the first spike of pressure
    in that the curve is mantained in one ascendant equilibrium providing the nexts steps of process.

To create oxygen (O2) using a nuclear method,
you would need to follow a multi-step process that involves nuclear reactions and subsequent chemical reactions.

Here's a hypothetical example:

1. Start with a source of helium-4 (He-4), such as from a nuclear reactor or a particle accelerator.

2. Initiate a nuclear fusion reaction between helium-4 (He-4) and a hydrogen isotope, such as deuterium (D), to produce beryllium-7 (Be-7):

He-4 + D -> Be-7

3. Allow the beryllium-7 (Be-7) to undergo radioactive decay, emitting a positron (e+) and a neutrino (ν):

Be-7 -> Li-7 + e+ + ν

4. Capture the positron (e+) by combining it with an electron (e-) in a process called electron-positron annihilation,
   which releases energy in the form of gamma rays:

e+ + e- -> γ + γ

5. Collect the lithium-7 (Li-7) produced in step 3 and react it with a proton (H+) to form two helium-4 (He-4) nuclei:

Li-7 + H+ -> 2He-4

6. Combine the two helium-4 (He-4) nuclei with two additional protons (H+) to create oxygen-16 (O-16):

2He-4 + 2H+ -> O-16

Note that this process is highly hypothetical and not currently achievable using practical methods.
It is presented here to demonstrate a theoretical approach for producing oxygen using nuclear reactions. In reality,
the production of oxygen primarily relies on chemical reactions,
such as the splitting of water molecules (H2O) or the oxidation of other compounds containing oxygen.

First implosive method to Nuclear fission:

To mount the cylinder to the implosive method of nuclear fission using the two-point linear implosion design,
the nuclear fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within the center of a cylinder of high explosive.
Detonators are placed at either end of the explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or shaper,
is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators.
The two ends of the cylinder are driven toward each other to create a high-density sphere.
Here are the steps to mount the cylinder to the implosive method of nuclear fission
using the two-point linear implosion design:

1. Cast the nuclear fuel into a solid shape.
2. Place the nuclear fuel in the center of a cylinder of high explosive.
3. Place detonators at either end of the explosive cylinder.
4. Place a plate-like insert, or shaper, in the explosive just inside the detonators.
5. Drive the two ends of the cylinder toward each other to create a high-density sphere.

Once the critical mass is assembled to maximum density, a burst of neutrons must be supplied to start the chain reaction.
Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator codenamed "Urchin" inside the pit containing
polonium-210 and beryllium separated by a thin layer of aluminum[1].

Second implosive method to Nuclear fission:

To mount the cylinder to the implosive method of nuclear fission using the hollow-pit implosion design,
a hollow plutonium pit is used instead of a solid one.
The hollow pit is designed to collapse symmetrically under the pressure of the high explosive lenses,
compressing the plutonium to a supercritical state.
Here are the steps to mount the cylinder to the implosive method of nuclear fission using the hollow-pit implosion design:

1. Design a hollow plutonium pit.
2. Place the hollow plutonium pit in the center of a cylinder of high explosive.
3. Place detonators at either end of the explosive cylinder.
4. Place a plate-like insert, or shaper, in the explosive just inside the detonators.
5. Detonate the high explosive lenses, which will compress the hollow pit symmetrically,
compressing the plutonium to a supercritical state.

The hollow-pit implosion design is more efficient than the solid-pit implosion design,
as it uses considerably less fissile material to obtain a given yield.
An implosion fission weapon with an explosive yield of one kiloton can be made with less fissile material than
a gun-assembly device with the same yield[1][2].
